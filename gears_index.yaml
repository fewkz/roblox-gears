  The katana originated in the Muromachi period (1392–1573) as a result of
  changing battle conditions requiring faster response times. The katana
  facilitated this by being worn with the blade facing up, which allowed the
  samurai to draw and cut their enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved
  sword of the samurai was worn with the blade facing down. The ability to draw
  and cut in one motion also became increasingly useful in the daily life of the
  samurai.

name: Bundle of TNT
description: >-
  Industrially, TNT is synthesized in a three-step process. First, toluene is
  nitrated with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid to produce
  mono-nitrotoluene or MNT. The MNT is separated and then renitrated to
  dinitrotoluene or DNT. In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to
  trinitrotoluene or TNT using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum.
  Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric
  acid can be reconcentrated and reused. Subsequent to nitration, TNT is
  stabilized by a process called sulphitation, where the crude TNT is treated
  with aqueous sodium sulfite solution in order to remove less stable isomers of
  TNT and other undesired reaction products. The rinse water from sulphitation
  is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT
  manufacture.

  It was hard, but you graduated college with a 4.2 GPA and got into a decent
  med school. Then you slogged through 4 more years of memorizing random facts.
  THEN you slaved away through 4 years of residency. THEN you got drafted by the
  army and make $45,000 a year. NOW you run around like mad, flinging medkits at
  your team mates just trying not to get shot. Yes. Law school was the right
  choice. You owned yourself.

  In the aftermath of World War VII, isolated pockets of human survivors raided
  ruined government labs, looking specifically for these weapons. The Spec X
  program had been accelerated in the late 2120s as the prospect of an all out
  metahuman vs. machine war became increasingly likely. Prized for their ability
  to slice through viridian steel exoskeletons, the US was determined to find a
  substitute for the pure diamond required for the manufacture of the Beta
  models. Sapphire, while still exorbitantly expensive, allowed the army to
  produce blades that were 95% as effective as the Betas, at only 20% the cost.

  You walk past a rug shop, where a clerk tries to sell you a magic carpet.  You
  tell him you don't want a magic carpet today. He then admits to you that he
  was lying, and this really is just a regular carpet. His whole life is a lie.
  Then he starts crying. You kind of have to buy it after that.  This is a
  regular carpet and it literally does nothing.

  bears were harmed in the making of this virtual polar bear robot. Please do
  not attempt to ride polar bears irl. Please do not attempt to attach lasers to
  real polar bears. Does not require batteries.  Is virtual.  Is subject to
  additional disclaimers in very small print below the bottom of this visible
  text. Not really though. If you meet a polar bear - please be cool and don't
  approach it.  This is actually good advice for pretty much any bear.

description: >-
  Slash at your foes and deal 15 damage per hit.  If you're looking to do
  something a little more interesting - hit 'Q' to grow vines that will stun and
  trap anyone within a 15 stud radius.  The 'E' key will shoot 10 vines in front
  of you to hit your opponents - doing  12 damage. Finally - press the 'X' key 
  to activate a vine like shield, which arises from the ground and surrounds you
  for 20 seconds. It does 20 damage to anyone who runs into it.

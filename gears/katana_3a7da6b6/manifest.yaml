name: Katana
description: >-
  The katana originated in the Muromachi period (1392â€“1573) as a result of
  changing battle conditions requiring faster response times. The katana
  facilitated this by being worn with the blade facing up, which allowed the
  samurai to draw and cut their enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved
  sword of the samurai was worn with the blade facing down. The ability to draw
  and cut in one motion also became increasingly useful in the daily life of the
  samurai.

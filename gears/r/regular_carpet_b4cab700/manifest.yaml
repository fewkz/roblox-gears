description: >-
  You walk past a rug shop, where a clerk tries to sell you a magic carpet.  You
  tell him you don't want a magic carpet today. He then admits to you that he
  was lying, and this really is just a regular carpet. His whole life is a lie.
  Then he starts crying. You kind of have to buy it after that.  This is a
  regular carpet and it literally does nothing.

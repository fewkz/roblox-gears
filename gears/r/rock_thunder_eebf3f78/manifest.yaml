  Your guitar has the lightning, now it's time to bring the thunder! You're
  gonna rock this stage. Change the chord using the keys, 'Z', 'X', 'C', 'V',
  'B', 'N', 'M'. Alter the pitch using the keys 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L'. Hold
  shift to sharpen the chords. Complete the synchronized pattern of notes
  special (hit the ctrl key to begin) with at least 75% accuracy to shoot out
  non-lethal blue lightning.

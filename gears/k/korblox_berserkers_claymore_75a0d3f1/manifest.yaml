name: 'Korblox: Berserker''s Claymore'
description: >-
  Crafted using their corrupted magic, this claymore is as deadly as it is
  heavy. Handed down from generation to generation to the mightiest Korbloxian
  warriors, this legendary weapon was once wielded by Canavus himself. 


  With its ability to double its strength in the blink of an eye, this weapon
  outmatches almost all weapons at close range. Only the mighty knight Xargas is
  said to have be able to hold his own against this claymore!

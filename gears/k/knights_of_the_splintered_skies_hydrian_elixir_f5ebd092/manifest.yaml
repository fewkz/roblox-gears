name: 'Knights of the Splintered Skies: Hydrian Elixir'
description: >-
  Over the centuries, many have wondered how the KoSS descend upon the realm in
  times of peril. Only but a few know, the true source of the KoSS' power. The
  Hydrian Elixir grants the KoSS the ability to grow wings and fly for a short
  period of time. Not only does the elixir give them the ability of flight, but
  also increases their strength twofold and the wings attack anyone that get
  near them!

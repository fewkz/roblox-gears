name: 'Knights of the Splintered Skies: Bow and Arrow '
description: >-
  While their strength lies in their speed and mobility, the Knights of the
  Splintered Skies are no less skillful in their ability to wield the bow.
  Blessed with purity of light, their arrows pierce through their enemies and
  lights them in skyfire, slowing them down and doing massive damage over time.

name: 'Knights of the Splintered Skies: Ballista'
description: >-
  While their capability to melee combat their opponents is only rivaled by the
  RedCliff Knights, the Knights of the Splintered Skies also make use of some
  heavy artillery. The ballista, a strong long range powerful artillery, is
  capable of shooting bolts at ridiculous speed and power, and destroying
  multiple targets at once. With its hidden ability to fire lit bolts that do
  constant light damage, the ballista is a powerful weapon indeed.

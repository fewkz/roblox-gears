description: >-
  Freezing ice crystal claws, which stop your enemies cold in their tracks!
  Quickly slash with both claws at your enemies, dealing around 25 damage per
  strike. Each time you hit someone, they're significantly slowed for a moment,
  making it that much more difficult to get away. There's also a 10% chance of
  freezing your enemies solid blue for 3 seconds.

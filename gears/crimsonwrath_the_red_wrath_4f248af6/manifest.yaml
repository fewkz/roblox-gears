  For when you're really mad bro. Send your enemies to meet their maker... or
  whatever. Click to slash; double click to lunge. When using, your speed is
  boosted 4 points making you slightly faster, enough to trail behind enemies
  which flee. Each kill, the sword gets even stronger for a few seconds! When
  killed, enemies turn into flaming transparent red ghosts which quickly fade
  away up into the sky!

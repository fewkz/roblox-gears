description: >-
  In the aftermath of World War VII, isolated pockets of human survivors raided
  ruined government labs, looking specifically for these weapons. The Spec X
  program had been accelerated in the late 2120s as the prospect of an all out
  metahuman vs. machine war became increasingly likely. Prized for their ability
  to slice through viridian steel exoskeletons, the US was determined to find a
  substitute for the pure diamond required for the manufacture of the Beta
  models. Sapphire, while still exorbitantly expensive, allowed the army to
  produce blades that were 95% as effective as the Betas, at only 20% the cost.

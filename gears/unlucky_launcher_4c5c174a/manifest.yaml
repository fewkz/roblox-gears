  Shoot bad luck at your competitors by launching broken mirrors, umbrellas, and
  ladders at them! Upon impact, they trip onto the ground. There is a 30% chance
  they will temporarily be cursed with bad luck!  If they become unlucky they
  will suffer one of the following effects: They'll either be tripped nonstop,
  have a blurry screen, or have their walk speed revered so if they're walking
  forward, they are actually working backwards!

name: Overseer's Axe
description: >-
  The Overseer has an endless arsenal of weapons, but the one weapon he knows he
  can always count on is his axe! Swing this at your foe to do up to 25 hit
  points of damage per hit. That's not enough for you?  Your foe will also
  encounter the wrath of an orb with a laser beam.

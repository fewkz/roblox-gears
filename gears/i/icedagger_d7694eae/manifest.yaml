  "Is this a dagger which I see before me,
  "The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. /
  I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. /
  Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible / 
  To feeling as to sight? or art thou but /
  A dagger of the mind, a false creation, /
  Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?"

name: Inglaciator -6000
description: >-
  Why -6000?  Because it launches an icy sphere of doom that is -6000 degrees. 
  Click and hold to charge up your icy projectile and release to launch it. When
  your ice hits - it will create an icy ball that grows over time. Anyone hit by
  the ice will take 30 damage.  Your foes' chances of survival? Absolute zero.

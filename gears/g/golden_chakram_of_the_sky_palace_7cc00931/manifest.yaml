name: Golden Chakram of the Sky Palace
description: >-
  This chakram was said to belong to a reclusive group of ninjas so enlightened
  that it was said they could communicate with inanimate objects. Legend has it
  they never carried more than one weapon, because they could call out to it
  from anywhere in the world, and it would always faithfully return.

description: >-
  Shoot snowballs at your enemies! Upon impact, the snowball will burst into a
  bunch of pieces of snow and scatter around the area it hit. Anyone hit is
  dealt 8 damage, and snow obscures their vision by covering their screen
  temporarily! This item is part of the Captain Snowbeard package.

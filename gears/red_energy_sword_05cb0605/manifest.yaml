name: Red Energy Sword
description: >-
  The last scientist who knew how to make energy swords passed away in a
  horrific energy sword accident.  Don't worry, he wasn't using his own energy
  swords (which function perfectly!).  He was testing a competitor's imitation
  sword when the energy suddenly exploded.  But this is not the end for energy
  swords!  They will live on.  How?  That's for another energy sword
  desciption.  How did we get these ones?  Duh - they were hidden in the
  scientist's basement.

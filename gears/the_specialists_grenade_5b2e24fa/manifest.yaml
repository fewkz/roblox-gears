description: >-
  Click and hold to have a chargeable bar appear on your screen. It'll quickly
  rise and lower. The closer the bar is to being full, the further you can throw
  the grenade. Let go of your mouse button when it's within a reasonable range
  of where your target lies. Be careful though - you can also be damaged by this
  grenade, which does 60 damage.

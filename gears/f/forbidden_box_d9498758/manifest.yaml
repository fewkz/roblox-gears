description: >-
  You know that box your gramps told you never to open?  Now you know why!  The
  Forbidden Box will summon several violent beasts, which will hunt down any
  player, friend or foe, who lays eyes on it or falls within its area of effect.
  You can spawn up to four monsters at a time, each of which is capable of
  dealing 10 points of damage per second.

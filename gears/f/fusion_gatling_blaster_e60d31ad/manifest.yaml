name: Fusion Gatling Blaster
description: >-
  This gun has two modes; rapid-fire lasers, and a flamethrower attachment. You
  can alternate between the two by hitting the 'Q' key.  For the laser shots,
  you click and hold, and the upper barrel slowly begin to spin with a
  Gatling-fire like sound effect. It gets faster and louder, shooting
  projectiles more rapidly until it's at its maximum speed. This is rapid-fire,
  so there's dozens of lasers hitting your enemies all at once. They each do 8
  damage.  The flamethrower, you click and hold as well, which a moderate sized
  flame blows out from the under-barrel of the gun.

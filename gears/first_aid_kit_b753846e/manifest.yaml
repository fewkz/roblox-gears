  It was hard, but you graduated college with a 4.2 GPA and got into a decent
  med school. Then you slogged through 4 more years of memorizing random facts.
  THEN you slaved away through 4 years of residency. THEN you got drafted by the
  army and make $45,000 a year. NOW you run around like mad, flinging medkits at
  your team mates just trying not to get shot. Yes. Law school was the right
  choice. You owned yourself.

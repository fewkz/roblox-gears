name: Spec Epsilon Biograft Energy Sword
description: >-
  The superintelligent cloud people of the distant future find the history of
  human conflict hilarious and ironic. To that end, they created these weapons
  to sell in museum gift shops as a living reminder of the pinnacle of human
  stupidity. (WHY DO YOU NEED HAND TO HAND WEAPONS WHEN YOU HAVE LAZORS?!)
  Because the cloud people are incorporeal, the swords are completely harmless
  and they allow their young to play with them.

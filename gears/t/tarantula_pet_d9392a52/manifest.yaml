name: Tarantula Pet
description: >-
  Click to summon a giant tarantula! A loyal friend, he'll follow you around
  until you command him to attack your enemy! Then, he'll chase after the enemy,
  shooting cobwebs at him. Once a web successfully strikes your foe, 25 damage
  is dealt and a large spiderweb wraps around his head, blinding him and slowing
  him down for 8 seconds. Now that your enemy is pretty much defenseless, this
  is when the tarantula goes in for the kill. Charging at your enemy, dealing 15
  damage per hit.

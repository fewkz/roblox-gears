name: The Sword of Shai
description: >-
  Your destiny awaits!  This sword has five different attacks, each does a
  varying amount of damage- anywhere from 6-12 points per hit.  One's fate is
  often not clear - so it's fitting that this sword of fate will will obscure
  the vision of your foes with a sand storm when they get within 20 studs of
  you.

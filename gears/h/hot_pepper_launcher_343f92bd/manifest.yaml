  That's a spicy pepper!  Shoot red, green, and yellow peppers at your foes.
  When your foes get hit by a red pepper, they will turn red and run around,
  flailing their arms uncontrollably! Green makes your opponents vomit greenish
  bricks. If your foes get hit with a yellow pepper, their speed will be
  reduced.  Each pepper does 20 damage per hit!

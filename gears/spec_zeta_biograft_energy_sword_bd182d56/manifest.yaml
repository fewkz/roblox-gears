name: Spec Zeta Biograft Energy Sword
description: >-
  After the tremendous success of the Epsilon sword, only one person was left
  who understood how to make energy swords.  This is largely due to the
  scientists testing the swords on one another in an effort to create the best
  product possible (and to keep all the profit for themselves).  The last
  scientist left standing created only 200 of these before he was spawn killed
  by a noob holding his own sword.

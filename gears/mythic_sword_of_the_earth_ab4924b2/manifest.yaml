name: Mythic Sword of the Earth
description: >-
  Protect Mother Earth with this mighty sword. Slash away at your enemies and
  leave behind a quaking trail of earth. 15 - 22 damage per swing. While the
  sword is equipped, the wielder leaves a trail of broken, quaking earth that
  causes anyone that steps on it to trip and fall.

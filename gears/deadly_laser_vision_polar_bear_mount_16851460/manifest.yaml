name: Deadly Laser Vision Polar Bear Mount
description: >-
  Rideable polar bear that shoots deadly laser beams out of his eyes. Hop on his
  back and use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', or the arrow keys to move around. Click to
  shoot deadly lasers from the polar bears eyes. If hit, your opponent will take
  40-70 points of damage.  Disclaimer- this is not a real polar bear. No polar
  bears were harmed in the making of this virtual polar bear robot. Please do
  not attempt to ride polar bears irl. Please do not attempt to attach lasers to
  real polar bears. Does not require batteries.  Is virtual.  Is subject to
  additional disclaimers in very small print below the bottom of this visible
  text. Not really though. If you meet a polar bear - please be cool and don't
  approach it.  This is actually good advice for pretty much any bear.

name: Leprechaun Harp
description: >-
  The harp that once through Tara's halls / The soul of music shed / Now hangs
  as mute on Tara's halls / As if that soul were fled / So sleeps the pride of
  former days / So glory's thrill is o'er / And hearts that once beat high for
  praise / Now feel that pulse no more

name: Artemis Bow
description: >-
  The Artemis Bow features two attack modes--you can charge a concentrated death
  shot that does up to 100 damage, or shoot in rapid fire mode for more arrows
  that deal 12 damage each.But that's not all - you can also use it to fly! When
  you jump, the Artemis Bow will grow wings and allow you to take flight.

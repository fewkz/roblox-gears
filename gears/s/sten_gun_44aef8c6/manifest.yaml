  Fires 500 rounds a minute, with over-sized, 50-round clips. While the strong
  recoil makes it inaccurate at long ranges, you should be ashamed of yourself
  if you unload fifty bullets and hit nothing but air. Each bullet does 15
  points of damage. Multiply that by 50 rounds and you've got enough damage to
  defeat more than a couple foes.

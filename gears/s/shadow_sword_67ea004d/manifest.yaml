description: >-
  Equipping the Shadow Sword shrouds your character in darkness. You immediately
  transform into a warrior wearing a jet-black suit and begin emitting a cloud
  of dark fog. While your appearance unnerves and disorients your opponents,
  each sword strike does 35 points of damage and pressing space twice teleports
  you forward.

name: Slateskin Potion
description: >-
  Ingredients: one part dust from the oldest mountain, two parts dirt from the
  deepest sea, three parts lava from the core of the earth, and one splinter
  from the Rock of Prometheus. Drinking this potion transforms your skin into
  rock, allowing you to take more damage than the average Robloxian. It also
  makes you heavier, which will slow you down slightly.

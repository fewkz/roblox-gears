name: Skeleton King's Sword
description: >-
  This sword features three unique swings and a spin move (tap “W” twice and
  left-click), each of which has a 20% chance of cracking an enemy’s joints. As
  if that wasn’t enough, each attack has a 22% chance of being critical (2.25x
  damage). Normal attacks do 25 damage, landing critical attacks at about 56.
  Bone has never been so dangerous.

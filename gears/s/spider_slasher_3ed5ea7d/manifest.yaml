  Click to slash double-click to lunge and do 12 damage. When you lunge, you
  also shoot a web in the the direction of your cursor. If it hits somebody,
  their speed is reduced to 6 for a few seconds, giving you an opportunity to
  catch up to them. While slashing your enemy with the sword, there is a 30%
  chance of poisoning them!

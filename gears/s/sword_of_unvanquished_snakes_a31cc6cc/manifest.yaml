name: Sword of Unvanquished Snakes
description: >-
  It's said that Saint Patrick rid Ireland of snakes.  What do you think he did
  with them?  Put them in the sword of course!  Now you can use this sword's
  special attack to send 15 snakes slithering dangerously towards your foes. 
  Also functions as a regular sword and does 10 damage per hit.

name: Sir Kitty McPawnington's Sword and Sheild
description: >-
  Slash, slash, scratch your enemies to deal 25 damage. Press and hold the 'Q'
  key to block. This slows you down, though it doubles your health. By clicking,
  you can whack your enemies with the shield. This does 30 to 40 damage. If you
  successfully hit someone with the shield, a cat screech sound plays. Part of
  the Sir Kitty McPawnington's Package.

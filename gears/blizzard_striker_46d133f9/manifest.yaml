  Everywhere you go, the freezing snow follows. Anyone who gets close to you
  while you are wielding this sword will lose health due to the pain of being
  near your icy cold weapon.  Click to slash at your enemies, dealing around 15
  damage per hit. There is a 20% chance your enemy will freeze into a block of
  ice for 15 seconds. This disables control over his character, making him
  unable to move and very vulnerable to your frozen attacks.  Let it go, indeed!

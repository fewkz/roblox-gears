  Punch with your vicious metal fist to do 15 damage. If double clicked, you
  swing the fists into each other.  Anyone unfortunate enough to get caught
  between them takes 50 damage! Click 'Q' to smash at the ground with the fists,
  creating boulders from the ground. Anyone hit by these boulders is dealt 40
  damage. Click 'E' to knock your fists together, creating a shock wave. If hit,
  a player is knocked back and dealt a tiny amount of damage.

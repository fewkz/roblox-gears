name: Steampunk Bow
description: >-
  Click and hold to build up steam pressure so you can shoot your arrows!  Once
  you have enough pressure, you can release to fire a heated piece of rebar at
  your foes to deal 35 damage. If you max out the boiler pressure, the bow will
  instead fire three pieces of rebar in a fan-shaped pattern. No matter how many
  projectiles you fire, their speed is determined by the amount of pressure in
  the system.

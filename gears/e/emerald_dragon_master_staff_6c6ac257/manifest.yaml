  Click and hold to charge this massive dragon roar like blast. Upon releasing
  your mouse, you lunge forward, launching a deadly blue fireball at your
  enemies.  When fully charged, the crystal orb located on the staff lights up
  on fire. Minimum damage is 15, maximum is 100 if charged entirely. There's a 1
  second reload in between each swing. Part of the Emerald Dragon Master
  Package.

description: >-
  Blow upon this mighty relic to summon a massive earthquake within a 30 stud
  radius of where you're standing. Unanchored bricks begin to shake and break
  apart, and players trip and fall to the ground, slowly losing health. Three
  shockwaves are sent out, dealing around 20 damage per hit.

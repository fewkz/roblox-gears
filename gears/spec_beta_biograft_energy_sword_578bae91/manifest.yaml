name: Spec Beta Biograft Energy Sword
description: >-
  In 2113, decades after the initial release of the hugely successful Spec Alpha
  biograft energy weapons, the US government began research on a top-secret
  upgrade. The breakthrough was to use artificial diamonds to forge the blade
  itself, rather that carbon nanofibers. The new weapon was very effective, but
  obscenely expensive. Only a hundred were ever made.

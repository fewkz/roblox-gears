description: >-
  Industrially, TNT is synthesized in a three-step process. First, toluene is
  nitrated with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid to produce
  mono-nitrotoluene or MNT. The MNT is separated and then renitrated to
  dinitrotoluene or DNT. In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to
  trinitrotoluene or TNT using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum.
  Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric
  acid can be reconcentrated and reused. Subsequent to nitration, TNT is
  stabilized by a process called sulphitation, where the crude TNT is treated
  with aqueous sodium sulfite solution in order to remove less stable isomers of
  TNT and other undesired reaction products. The rinse water from sulphitation
  is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT
  manufacture.

  I want to be a rock star, and travel really far, and buy / me a big expensive
  car. /

  And make lots of money and find me a honey. /

  And live in nice big house where it's sunny. /

  With a pool and I'll be cool. /

  I'll always have a gig cause I'll be big. /

  I'll have parties and friends and places to go, /

  The only problem is I play the banjo. - Ryan Shupe

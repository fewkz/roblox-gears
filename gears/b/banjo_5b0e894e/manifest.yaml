description: "I want to be a rock star, and travel really far, and buy / me a big expensive car. /\r\nAnd make lots of money and find me a honey. /\r\nAnd live in nice big house where it's sunny. /\r\nWith a pool and I'll be cool. /\r\nI'll always have a gig cause I'll be big. /\r\nI'll have parties and friends and places to go, /\r\nThe only problem is I play the banjo. - Ryan Shupe"

name: Bejeweled Sword of Great Fury
description: >-
  Do you see red or blue?  This fierce sword lets you switch between Ruby and
  Sapphire attacks.  In Ruby mode you deal 40 damage per hit, but take 15 damage
  yourself. In Sapphire mode you do 15 damage per hit, but can strike at a great
  speed, and heal yourself with each hit you land.

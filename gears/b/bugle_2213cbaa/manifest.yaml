description: "He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way / He had a boogie style that no one else could play / He was the top man at his craft, but then his number came up and he was gone with the draft / He's in the army now / He's blowin' reveille /\r\nHe's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B"
